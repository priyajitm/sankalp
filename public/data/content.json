      "message": "Every child has the right to avail equal opportunities as others, regardless of the difficulties they face. Special education is of great importance for children with learning disabilities, because it gives them the opportunity to get quality education in line with their unique needs. Special education enables every student to gain a high level of independence and reach their full potential. According to UNICEF, about 93 million children around the world have been diagnosed with some form of disability. Over 50% of that number do not attend school at all, which robs them of the right to a better life. In order to meet specific student needs an Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) is created for each child with learning disabilities. This way, the school designs an educational plan they need to implement based on the identified disability. The IEP is designed by a team comprising teachers, specialists (e.g. special education teachers) and family. The role of parents is crucial in this process, because they know their child best, and can provide a lot of valuable information.",
